		<p>The image above is a photographic representation of my goals and plans for the future. They can be further broken down into a few subcategories:</p>

		<dl>
			<dt>Career</dt>
			<dd>My goal is to work for a renowned retail or CPG company after school in merchandise planning or brand management. I believe that the company I'm working for this summer has the potential to be the place I end up at after school, as a majority of their interns receive return offers after the program. So far I have enjoyed all of my interactions with their employees and the company, and could see myself working their for at least a couple years after college.</dd>

			<dt>City</dt>
			<dd>After graduation, I hope to live in a medium-to-large city. I grew up 40 minutes outside of Chicago, and have always enjoyed day trips to the city because there is so much to do. I'm a big foodie, so having a wide variety of restaurants in close proximity is something that I enjoy about cities.</dd>

			<dt>Travel</dt>
			<dd>I have been very fortunate to be able to travel throughout my life. I hope to continue doing so in the future since it is the one thing that I enjoy spending my money on the most. Spring semester in school has always been tough for me, so this year I decided to plan an entire weekend trip to Puerto Rico, and things worked out perfectly. It was a great escape from the stress of college and I would definitely do it agian. After this spontaneous experience, I decided that I want to travel to more places outside of my comfort zone, so some places on my list include Alaska, Australia, Thailand, and just about everywhere else. I plan to do lots of travling in the future.</dd>

			<dt>Friends and Family</dt>
			<dd>I hope the friends I made these past couple years are friends that stick around. I can see myself staying in contact with everyone on my friends list and hopefully planning a few visits after school to see them at least once a year, assuming we don't already live near each other. Friends and family are the most important things in my life and the people I surround myself with make everything so much better and I hope we remain as close as we can in the future.</dd>

			<dt>Marathon</dt>
			<dd>I picked up running when I quit soccer my senior year of high school, and it is one of my favorite hobbies to this day. I try to get out at least three times a week minimum. Running has made me feel better both physically and mentally and I hope to keep doing it as long as I can. That being said, my goal for the near future is to run a half-marathon, and hopefully work my way up to a full marathon down the line. It would be a great testiment to how far I've come with running. I started out only being able to last a mile, to now being able to run 9.</dd>

			<dt>Dogs</dt>
			<dd>I'm a very big dog person. When I was in high school, my mom decided to adopt three dogs and my dad adopted one. I have always loved the companionship of a dog and they are such amazing animals to be around. They are entertaining and comforting and I couldn't imagine a life without them. That being said, I plan to adopt at least two dogs in the future as soon as I get settled and have my own place. I'm not too picky on the breed, it's more about personality in my opinon, but I had a few ideas of breeds including, portuguese water dogs, german shorthaired pointers, and dobermans.</dd>
