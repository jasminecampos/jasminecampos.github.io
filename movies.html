	<p>I am not sure if this is a hot take or not, but I enjoyed <i>Top Gun Maverick</i> more than the original <i>Top Gun</i>. It had a lot to do with the plot as well as the effects. In the original, I felt very lost throughout the movie and thought it didn't quite follow an organized timeline. I like all of the elements incorporated from the original into Maverick, like Great Balls of Fire, bringing back Iceman, etc. I also <strong>LOVE</strong> Miles Teller which definitely played into this rating.</p>

	<p>I gave this movie a 7 because this is one of those movies where I read the book before watching the movie. While I thought the producers did a great job of keeping things relatively consistent, I think that the movie just didn't completely do the book justice (as usual). This movie still has an amazing plot followed by a twist at the end. It's got everything, mystery, romance, action, and drama. </p>

	<h2>Sixteen Candles: 10/10</h2>

	<p>I had to include this movie because it is my all time favorite comfort movie. I recently watched it twice on the coach bus from Madison to Ohare Airport when I was traveling to San Juan Puerto Rico. It's super funny, has a <i> pretty good </i> romance arc between Sam and Jake and reminds me a lot of my dysfucntional families. I have probably seen this movie 20 times and will watch it a thousand more.</p>

	<h2>Don't Worry Darling: 6/10</h2>
	<center><img src="dont-worry-darling.jpeg" alt="Don't Worry Darling movie poster" width="68%" height="68%"></center>
	<p>This one is definitely going to be controversial because so many people love this movie. I genuinely think it's only because of the cast, because the plot, while interesting, was very predictable and slow. I'd give 3 points for the cast, 2 for the plot, and 1 for part of it being set in a 50s-esque time period, I thought that was fun with the cars and outfits.</p>
