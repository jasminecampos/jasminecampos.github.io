	<p>This is one of my favorite healthy meals to make in college, and the best part is that all of the work is in the prep time. After all the vegies are chopped and everything is added to the bot, all you have to do is let it simmer for half an hour. My favorite toppings to add are sour cream, 3 cheese mexican style blend, and sometimes an avocado. If you want to spice things up, you can even add pasta as a base (or Banza if you're keeping it healthy).</p>
