		<h1> Meet My Friends and Family </h1>

		
		<h2>Hannah Van Pay</h2>

		<p>I met Hannah my very first semester freshman year at UW Madison. We were both chosen to be in the Fall 2020 PC of Alpha Kappa Psi, a professional fraternity on campus, and grew even closer outside of the organization. She is my best friend now and we have plans to backpack across Europe after our early graduation.</p>

		<h2>Claire Salemi</h2>

		<p>Claire has been one of my best friends since high school. We somehow ended up at the same university, with the same major, and are now also in the same PC in AKPsi. She has been by my side through many life changes and I look forward to living with her next year when she comes back from her semester abroad in Rome.</p>

		<h2>Kyler Kamis</h2>

		<p>I met Kyler before the Fall 2022 semester started. Right off the bat we had so much in common and lots to talk about. After about 2 month of being friends we began dating. Since then, we have made so many amazing memories like traveling to Chicago, Tuscon, and San Juan all within the span of one month.</p>

		<h2>Jenna Krause</h2>

		<p>My friendship with Jenna is the definition of serendipitous. We met our first month of college in the Covid dorms (Mack Hall in Kronsage to be specific). In the midst of our unfortunate circumstances, we got very close and bonded over our neighboring hometowns, which is very uncommon to find among out of state students. After the Covid dorms, we kept in touch and are currently roommates.</p>

		<h2>Mom's Side of the Family</h2>

		<p>My mom's side of the family consists of my mom Athena, my brother Alex, and my stepdad Rob. One of my favorite memories is our trip to Greece when my stepdad thought he could drive a big van down a narrow trail made for mopeds. Despite the odds being against him, he managed to get us down and back and it was terrifying yet so much fun. I love my very disfunctional family.</p>

		<h2>Dad's side of the Family</h2>

		<p>My dad's side of the family consists of my dad Joe, brother Alex, stepmom Emily, and stepsister Ava. One of my favorite memories is getting our very first boat and spending at least 3 days a week on it during our very first summer as new boat owners. I have so much love for both sides of my family.</p>
