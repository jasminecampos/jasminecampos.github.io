		<h2> About Me! </h2>


		<p> My name is Jasmine Campos and I am currently a Junior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I am originally from Libertyville, Illinois which is a suburb just 40 minutes north of Chicago. At school, I am majoring in Marketing with a ceritificate in Digital Studies and plan to graduate after the Fall 2023 semester. On campus I am heavily involved in my business fraternity, Alpha Kappa Psi, where I have been a selected member since Fall 2020, served as Marketing Chair Spring 2022, and served as Vice President of Internal Communications Fall 2022. This summer I am excited to head to Columbus, Ohio for my internship with Abercrombie & Fitch in their Merchandise Planning department. I'm looking forward to gaining my first hands-on experience in corporate retail and getting a taste of what my career will be like after school. After I graduate in the Fall I plan on going on a three-month backpacking trip across Europe with my best friend, Hannah. We started planning this a year ago and I can't wait for all of it to come to life. Aside from school and work, my hobbies include thrifting & upcycling, baking, reading, and running. </p>
