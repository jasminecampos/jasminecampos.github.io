	<p>The list of ingredients are:</p>
	<ul>
			<li>10 ounce package of cherry tomatoes</li>
			<li>olive oil</li>
			<li>one tablespoon of minced garlic</li>
			<li>~ 8oz block of feta cheese</li>
			<li>one box of the pasta of your choice</li>
			
		</ul>

	<p>I found this recipe on Tik Tok and immediately tried it because I love the ingredients and really enjoyed that it doesn't require dirtying a lot of dishes. A description of the recipe can be found <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/article/10-easy-dinners-with-5-ingredients-or-less/" target="_blank">HERE</a>, but since it's a very simple recipe, the steps are as follows:</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Preheat your oven to 400 degrees fahrenheit</li>
		<li>Wash and place a pack of cherry tomatoes in the baking dish</li>
		<li>Drizzle about 3 tablespoons of olive oil above the top of the tomatoes and add in a tablespoon of minced garlic and mix it so the oil coats all of the tomatoes</li>
		<li>Sprinkle salt and pepper over the tomatoes as desired</li>
		<li>Place the full block of feta in the middle of the dish</li>
		<li>Once the oven is preheated, place the baking dish in the oven and cook for 30-35 minutes.</li>
		<li>While the tomatoes and feta are in the oven, cook your pasta based on the insturctions on the box and drain the noodles when done</li>
		<li>Once the tomatoes and feta are out of the oven, stir up the mixure while it's hot so it breaks up and forms a thick sauce consistency</li>
		<li>Add the noodles to the mixture</li>
	</ol>

<p>This is one of my favorite meals to make when I am on a tight budget week during the school year and most of these ingredients are relatively inexpensive. Enjoy!</p>
